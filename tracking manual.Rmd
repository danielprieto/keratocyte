This handout is intended to guide you through the process of manually tracking cellular pathways from a set of pictures, and to calibrate the dataset for further parameter extraction and analysis.

# Manual tracking of a cellular migration pathway

* Create a stack with the time sequence of the events to analyze. This step combines open images into a stack of images in a single file. It is with *this* file you will be working with from now on.

### Open all images from your sequence of interest.  

>File>Open  

```{r, out.width = "50%", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Descargas/kct/Bambed Keratocytes/practico/images.png")
```

### Create a stack with these images.  

>Image > Stacks > Images to stack  

```{r, out.width = "50%", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Descargas/kct/Bambed Keratocytes/practico/stack.png")
```

* Note that the time sequence might not be correct in this stack; remember to verify the order of the images within the stack. In case some corrections were needed, use the *stack sorter* tool.  

Image > Stacks > Tools > Stack Sorter  

```{r, out.width = "50%", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Descargas/kct/Bambed Keratocytes/practico/stack_sort.png")
```

* At this point the image stack should be calibrated in order to self-contain real size/time data.

### Calibrate the dataset
* Calibrate using a scale bar.   

Analyze > Set scale   

```{r, out.width = "50%", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Descargas/kct/Bambed Keratocytes/practico/scale.png")
```
  
Once calibrated, we will need to know the xy resolution of our stack.   
  
Image > Properties   
  
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Descargas/kct/Bambed Keratocytes/practico/properties.png")
```  
  
### Track paths  
Open the *Manual Tracking* plugin window.  

Plugins > Manual Tracking  

```{r, out.width = "50%", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Descargas/kct/Bambed Keratocytes/practico/tracking_params.png")
```  

* Fill in the *xy calibration* field with the data obtained beforehand, as explained above.  
Define a point of reference with the button *Add reference*, then click with the mouse pointer on the image where you want the point of reference to be.   


* Establish the first track *Add track*, click on a determined part of the particle we want to track (in our example, the center of the dark region of the cell). A results window will open showing the position and displacement in the previously defined units of measurement.  

```{r, out.width = "50%", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Descargas/kct/Bambed Keratocytes/practico/track_over.png")
```   

* Simultaneously, the window with the image stack will have moved one step forward into the stack. Repeat the procedure until finishing the track. At this point we should click on *End Track*.  

* This step will be repeated for each of the particles (cells), whose paths we want to track.  

To check your tracks have been correctly established and measured, we will ask ImageJ to show the tracks (e.g.,*Overlay Dots & Lines*).  

```{r, out.width = "50%", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Descargas/kct/Bambed Keratocytes/practico/tracks.png")
```  

* Finally, save your data as a table for further analysis.  

File > Save as (in the results window)

What you will have saved will actually be a text file, with its *fields* being delimited by tabs. This is something important to be aware of, as it will be defined in the analysis script.}

## Plugins you will require

* Manual Tracking (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/track/track.html)
* WCIF plugins bundle (http://www.uhnresearch.ca/facilities/wcif/WrightCellImagingFacility%203/software/ImageJ_WCIF_plugins_only.zip)
* Chemotaxis and Migration tool (http://ibidi.com/xtproducts/en/Software-and-Image-Analysis/Manual-Image-Analysis/Chemotaxis-and-Migration-Tool)

### To get them installed, copy them to ImageJ plugins folder:

* Under GNU/Linux (the .imagej folder, whithin which is the *plugins* folder) is in `/home/username` and it is usually hidden (ctrl+h to show hidden folders). 
* Under MS Windows (ImageJ folder) is ussually found in `C:\Program Files\`, whithin which is the *plugins* folder.
