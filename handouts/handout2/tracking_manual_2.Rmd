In order to process and analyze pathway data you will use the *Chemotaxis and Migration Tool* plugin for ImageJ. This tool relies on the existence of datasets previously generated by the *Manual Tracking* plugin.

# Data analysis

## Load data

* Open the dialog box  

Plugins > Chemotaxis Tool  

* Load a dataset (output generated by the *Manual Tracking* plugin).  

\begin{center}
Import data  
\includegraphics[width=3in]{1.png}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{2.png}
\end{center}

Each dataset will go to the dropdown list *Imported datasets* within the *Import dataset* tab.  
In the dropdown list *Number of slices* select the data range you want to analyze. Suppose our measurements were taken from 10 displacement steps, there we could choose whether to use the entire dataset, or with the fist 5 steps, etc. Once you have defined this choose Add dataset.

## Calibrate the tool  

Select the dataset(s) to process by clicking Selected Dataset.
In the settings tab, use the calibration you got for the original image (the same xy calibration used with the *Manual Tracking* plugin). Do not forget to select the right units of measurement!
You can also calibrate time if the images were taken at regular intervals.  

\begin{center}
Apply settings  
\includegraphics[width=3in]{3.png}
\end{center}

## Graphs

The simplest scenario is obtained with the pathways plot. The pathways plot depicts the direction of migration for each particle analyzed. Statistical analyses can be performed with these data if desired.  

* In the Plot features tab, select Plot graph.  

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{4.png}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{5.png}
Save the graph as image
File > Save as...
\end{center}



## Tendencies

We will perform a tendency analysis using a rose plot, where the petals will be longer the more particles accumulate in a determined direction.  

* In the Diagram feature tab select Plot Rose diagram.  

We will obtain as a result a diagram depicting the bias of movements as a function of particle amount.

\end{center}

## Migrated distance and speed

### Migrated distance  

As we have calibrated our system beforehand, we can obtain a list of migrated distances in each track.

* In the Statistic feature tab select Track series > Distance.

With it we will obtain a listing of migrated distances. Note that the report will produce two different distances: accumulated and Euclidean distances.


### Migration speed

* In the Statistic feature tab select Track series > Velocity.  

We will obtain a table with the average speed of each particle. Again, we will only be able to get these measurements if we have calibrated our system beforehand. In this case, it is mandatory that the images had been taken at regular time intervals.

## Plugins you will require

* Manual Tracking (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/track/track.html)
* WCIF plugins bundle (http://www.uhnresearch.ca/facilities/wcif/WrightCellImagingFacility%203/software/ImageJ_WCIF_plugins_only.zip)
* Chemotaxis and Migration tool (http://ibidi.com/xtproducts/en/Software-and-Image-Analysis/Manual-Image-Analysis/Chemotaxis-and-Migration-Tool)

### To get them installed, copy them to ImageJ plugins folder:

* Under GNU/Linux (the .imagej folder, whithin which is the *plugins* folder) is in `/home/username` and it is usually hidden (ctrl+h to show hidden folders). 
* Under MS Windows (ImageJ folder) is ussually found in `C:\Program Files\`, whithin which is the *plugins* folder.
